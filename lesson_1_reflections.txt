How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    By seeing differing lines one can see typos immediately
    The differing lines can be compared regarding syntax
    passages that have been added to code can be viewed seperately and gone through mistake-check

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    When I'm working o projects for long periods of time I can still see whether I had a feature in     some previous version
    I can also identify sections of my project that I haven't worked on very much yet
    If some newer version turns out unstable I still have the last stable version available

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    manually
        +setting the size of my commits myself
        +better to understand if every commit indicates one change/task
        -I might forget
        
    automatically
        +I can't forget
        -commits might not be understandable/searchable
        
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Many projects will consist of different files since different file-types can be linked to each
    other in many projects. So it's only reasonable to save them in a big "repository"
    
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat shows me all commits with some change-indicators on them e.g. deleted and added
    lines of code
    with git diff I can see all changes between two specific commits giving me the possibility to       look for errors directly
    
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    Since I know that I can bring back the code as it was before I'd be more confident to make
    changes that might break something
    
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version-ctrl
