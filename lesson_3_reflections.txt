When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I could do so if I wanted to work on my project from different computers or want to collaborate on something with.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  It's better to keep publib repos and the data on my computer seperate because if I want to work on something on my machine it would be confusing to have updates getting pulled atomatically.
